## Inspired Tinkering

I attended the [*Real World Risk Institute* Seminar](https://realworldrisk.com) (iteration 15) earlier in 2021 and simultaneously started visiting the [global reading club meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/global-technical-incerto-reading-club/) of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's first book of the technical Incerto series: ["Statistical Consequences of Fat Tails"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10488).

Among other things both events inspired me to "code-up" statistical examples, using the [Julia language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10488).

The first example can be seen [here](https://david.wilde-ventures.com/SCFT/chapter04_01.html), 
and code can be checked-out [here](https://github.com/davidchris/RWRI15Tinkering.jl/blob/main/src/SCFT-examples/chapter_04.jl).

My current plan--undoubtedly changing in the future--is to add these examples to this [repository](https://github.com/davidchris/RWRI15Tinkering.jl)

## Why?

As to the reason why I'm doing this: practice--practice in the Julia language and practice of mathematical and statistical understanding--then, I will see what to make of this next.
