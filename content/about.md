My name is David Wilde, I'm based in Berlin, Germany.

My educational background is in economics, which I augment more and more with applied mathematics, statistics, probability and software development.
These days I'm highly interested and spend most of my time in Data Science, specifically in it's applications in (automated) decision making under uncertainty and risk management.

Beyond that, I have an inclination towards pragmatic and servant-style leadership to deliver a meaningful impact in my work.

I love to read a lot about the above mentioned topics.

This space here is mostly intended to write about personal projects and maybe more--baby-steps and iteration.
